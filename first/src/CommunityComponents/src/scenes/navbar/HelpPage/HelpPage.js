          for other users' content.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Spread Positivity and Support:</strong> Liking posts
              allows users to spread positivity and show support for each
              other's content. By liking a post, users can express appreciation
              for the content shared by others, creating a supportive and
              encouraging atmosphere within the community.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Acknowledge Resonance:</strong> Liking posts indicates
              that the content resonates with the user. It serves as a way to
              acknowledge the value of the content and the effort put into
              creating it. Users can use likes to recognize posts that they find
              interesting, insightful, or inspiring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Encourage Engagement:</strong> Liking posts encourages
              engagement and interaction among users. When users see that their
              posts are being liked by others, it motivates them to continue
              sharing content and participating in discussions. This cycle of
              engagement fosters a sense of community and connection among
              users.

              contributions. Whether it's a heartfelt story, a helpful tip, or a
              creative piece of content, likes convey gratitude and recognition
              for the effort and thoughtfulness behind the post.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build Relationships:</strong> Liking posts can help users
              build relationships and connections within the community. It's a
              non-verbal way to establish rapport with other users and initiate
              interactions. Over time, consistent liking can lead to mutual
              support, collaboration, and friendship among community members.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhance Visibility:</strong> Posts with a higher number of
              likes tend to receive more visibility within the community. When
              users like a post, it increases its visibility in the feed, making
              it more likely to be seen by others. This increased visibility can
              lead to more engagement and interaction with the post, amplifying
              its impact.
